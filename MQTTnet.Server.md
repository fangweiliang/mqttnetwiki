# MQTTnet.Server
_MQTTnet.Server_ is a extensible standalone MQTT server which runs on Windows, Linux and macOS. It can be also used on devices like a Raspberry Pi.

If you're searching for some binaries to run, you can give the [SimpleMqttServer](https://github.com/SeppPenner/SimpleMqttServer) project a try. It just starts up a small MQTT server which can be configured by a json file.
