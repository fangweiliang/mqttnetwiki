# Logging
It is recommended to disable logging (Global logger or custom logger) which running in a live environment because it adds a huge overhead to message processing. It should be avoided to attach to the global MQTTnet logger at all because an already attached method (which may not process the entry further on) leads to generation of log messages internally.
